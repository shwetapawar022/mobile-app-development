Absolutely, Shweta! Let’s break down the different types of mobile apps so you can choose the style that best fits your goals. 📲
📱 Types of Mobile Apps
| Type | Description | Examples | 
| Native | Built specifically for one platform (Android or iOS). Offers the best performance and access to device features. | WhatsApp, Instagram | 
| Hybrid | Combines web and native elements. Developed using web tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but runs inside a native container. | Gmail, Twitter (early version) | 
| Web | Accessed via a browser, not installed. Responsive design mimics native apps. Best for simple tools and broad accessibility. | AliExpress Web, Flipkart Web | 
| Progressive Web App (PWA) | Advanced version of web apps. Works offline, sends push notifications, and loads fast. Great for low-resource environments. | Pinterest PWA, Starbucks PWA | 
| Cross-Platform | Developed with frameworks that compile to native code for multiple platforms. Saves time and effort. | Google Ads, Reflectly | 


Each type comes with pros and cons related to performance, cost, time-to-market, and user experience.
